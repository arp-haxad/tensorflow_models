# tensorflow_models
a  aimple linear model builded from tensorflow (keras) to predict the kernel ans bias of a simple linear equation with two variables 3xs -2 zs +4 + random_noise .
optomiser =  custom optimizer based on sgd
loss function = mean squared errror / l2 norm / regression based / averaged mean error/
